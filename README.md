# Talk to an LLM in Slack (Slackbot template from WDAI)

A Slack bot that uses OpenAI's GPT-4o model to respond to messages, analyze images, process CSV data, and extract information from PDFs.  Originally created for the purposes of enabling more AI experiments in-channel for our Women Defining AI micro-learning program participants, this repo is a templatized version of our Slackbot implementation that is open so that others can build their own AI Slackbot

## Features
This template relies on OpenAI APIs for LLM capabiltiies, but you can continue to expand on these capabilities by integrating other LLM and providers for various features.
- **AI-Powered Conversations**: Responds to messages using OpenAI's GPT-4o model
- **Conversation Memory**: Maintains context by tracking conversation history in threads
- **Multi-Modal Capabilities**:
  - **Image Analysis**: Describes and answers questions about images
  - **Image Generation**: Creates custom images using DALL-E 3 based on text prompts
  - **CSV Processing**: Analyzes tabular data shared in CSV format
  - **PDF Extraction**: Extracts and summarizes content from PDF documents
  - **Text File Handling**: Processes plain text files

## Setup and Deployment

### Prerequisites

- Slack Workspace with Admin privileges
- OpenAI API Key
- Railway account (or other platform for deployment)
- GitHub account (for CI/CD)

### Environment Variables

- `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`: Your Slack Bot User OAuth Token
- `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`: Your Slack App Signing Secret
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API Key
- `MAX_THREAD_HISTORY` (optional): Maximum number of messages to retrieve from a thread (default: 10)
- `ALLOWED_CHANNEL` (optional): Channel ID where the bot is allowed to respond (if not set, bot works in all channels)

### ⚠️ Security Warning

**IMPORTANT**: Never commit your actual `.env` file or any file containing real API keys, tokens, or secrets to your repository. Only commit the `.env.example` file with placeholder values.

- **API Tokens**: If you accidentally expose your API tokens, immediately rotate them (create new ones and invalidate the old ones) in the respective dashboards.
- **Environment Variables**: Always use environment variables for sensitive information, especially in production.
- **Git Practices**: Make sure `.env` is included in your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental commits.

### 🔒 Enhanced Security Features

#### PII Redaction in Logs

This bot includes an advanced logging system that automatically redacts personally identifiable information (PII) from log files, including:

- Email addresses
- IP addresses
- Phone numbers
- Social Security Numbers
- Credit card numbers
- API keys and tokens

This prevents sensitive information from being exposed in log files while still providing useful debugging information. All logs are stored in the `logs/bot_activity.log` file by default.

To configure logging behavior, you can set the following environment variables:
- `LOG_DIR`: Directory where logs will be stored (default: `logs`)
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Minimum log level to record (default: `INFO`)

#### Rate Limiting

The bot implements rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage across users and teams. Rate limiting works on two levels:

- **User-level**: Limits how many requests each individual user can make in a time window
- **Team-level**: Limits the total requests across all users in a team/workspace

When a user exceeds their rate limit, they'll receive a polite message indicating when they can try again. This protects the bot from unintentional flooding and ensures a responsive experience for all users.

Rate limiting can be customized using these environment variables:
- `RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED`: Enable or disable rate limiting (default: `true`)
- `USER_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW`: Time window in seconds for user rate limiting (default: `60`)
- `USER_RATE_LIMIT_MAX`: Maximum number of requests per user in the window (default: `10`)
- `TEAM_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW`: Time window in seconds for team rate limiting (default: `60`)
- `TEAM_RATE_LIMIT_MAX`: Maximum number of requests per team in the window (default: `100`)

The bot also includes an automatic cleanup process to prevent memory growth from stored rate limit data.

### Installation

1. **Create a Slack App**:
   - Go to [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) and create a new app
   - Add the following Bot Token Scopes:
     - `app_mentions:read` - For reading when your bot is mentioned
     - `channels:history` - For viewing messages in public channels where the bot is added
     - `chat:write` - For sending messages as the bot
     - `files:read` - For viewing files shared with the bot
     - `files:write` - For uploading generated images to Slack
   - Install the app to your workspace

2. **Deploy the Bot**:
   - Clone this repository
   - Connect to Railway
   - Set the required environment variables
   - Deploy the application

3. **Configure Slack Event Subscriptions**:
   - Enable Events API
   - Set the Request URL to your deployed app's URL + `/slack/events`
   - Subscribe to the following bot events:
     - `message.channels`
     - `app_mention`

## Deployment on Railway

### Setting Up Railway

1. Create a [Railway](https://railway.app/) account if you don't have one.
2. Create a new project from your GitHub repository.
3. Set up the required environment variables:
   - In the Railway dashboard, go to your project
   - Click on the "Variables" tab
   - Add all the environment variables from your `.env.example` file:
     - `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`
     - `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`
     - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
     - `MAX_THREAD_HISTORY` (optional)
     - `ALLOWED_CHANNEL` (optional)
     - `PORT` (Railway will set this automatically, but you can override it)
4. Deploy your application:
   - Railway will automatically deploy your application when you push to your repository
   - You can also manually deploy from the Railway dashboard

### Network Access Requirements

For certain features to work properly, your deployment environment needs:

- **File Storage**: For processing image generation results, the bot needs temporary file storage access.

If you're experiencing issues with these features, check your deployment platform's documentation about file system access.

### Slack Configuration for Deployed Bot

1. After deployment, Railway will provide you with a URL for your application
2. Copy this URL and go to your Slack App's settings
3. Under "Event Subscriptions", enable events and set the Request URL to:
   ```
   https://your-railway-app-url.railway.app/slack/events
   ```
4. Save changes and verify the URL

### Testing Your Deployment

1. Invite your bot to a channel in your Slack workspace
2. Mention the bot with a message
3. Check Railway logs if you encounter any issues

## Usage

### Basic Interaction

Mention the bot with `@Bot Name` in any channel it's invited to, or send it a direct message.

### Image Analysis

Attach an image to your message to have the bot analyze it:
```
@Bot Name What's in this image?
[image attachment]
```

### Image Generation

Ask the bot to create images with DALL-E 3:
```
@Bot Name generate an image of a cat riding a bicycle
```
or
```
@Bot Name create a funny meme about programming
```
