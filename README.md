## Setup and Deployment

### Prerequisites

- **Slack Workspace with Admin privileges**: You need admin access to a Slack workspace to create and install a bot. You can create a free Slack team for testing purposes if needed.
- **OpenAI API Key**: Create an account at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) and generate an API key
- **Railway account**: Sign up at [Railway](https://railway.app/) for deploying your bot (free tier available)
- **GitHub account**: Required to fork this template and connect with Railway

### Environment Variables

Environment variables are settings that need to be configured for your bot to work. You'll set these up in Railway during deployment:

- `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`: Your Slack Bot User OAuth Token (you'll get this when creating your Slack App)
- `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`: Your Slack App Signing Secret (also provided when creating your Slack App)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API Key
- `MAX_THREAD_HISTORY` (optional): Maximum number of messages to retrieve from a thread (default: 10)
- `ALLOWED_CHANNEL` (optional): Channel ID where the bot is allowed to respond (if not set, bot works in all channels)
- `LOG_DIR` (optional): Directory where logs will be stored (default: `logs`)
- `LOG_LEVEL` (optional): Minimum log level to record (default: `INFO`)
- `RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED` (optional): Enable or disable rate limiting (default: `true`)
- `USER_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW` (optional): Time window in seconds for user rate limiting (default: `60`)
- `USER_RATE_LIMIT_MAX` (optional): Maximum number of requests per user in the window (default: `10`)
- `TEAM_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW` (optional): Time window in seconds for team rate limiting (default: `60`)
- `TEAM_RATE_LIMIT_MAX` (optional): Maximum number of requests per team in the window (default: `100`)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning

**IMPORTANT**: Never commit your actual `.env` file or any file containing real API keys, tokens, or secrets to your repository. Only commit the `.env.example` file with placeholder values.

- **API Tokens**: If you accidentally expose your API tokens, immediately rotate them (create new ones and invalidate the old ones) in the respective dashboards.
- **Environment Variables**: Always use environment variables for sensitive information, especially in production.
- **Git Practices**: Make sure `.env` is included in your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental commits.

### üîí Enhanced Security Features

#### PII Redaction in Logs

This bot includes an advanced logging system that automatically redacts personally identifiable information (PII) from log files, including:

- Email addresses
- IP addresses
- Phone numbers
- Social Security Numbers
- Credit card numbers
- API keys and tokens

This prevents sensitive information from being exposed in log files while still providing useful debugging information. All logs are stored in the `logs/bot_activity.log` file by default.

To configure logging behavior, you can set the following environment variables:
- `LOG_DIR`: Directory where logs will be stored (default: `logs`)
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Minimum log level to record (default: `INFO`)

#### Rate Limiting

The bot implements rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage across users and teams. Rate limiting works on two levels:

- **User-level**: Limits how many requests each individual user can make in a time window
- **Team-level**: Limits the total requests across all users in a team/workspace

When a user exceeds their rate limit, they'll receive a polite message indicating when they can try again. This protects the bot from unintentional flooding and ensures a responsive experience for all users.

Rate limiting can be customized using these environment variables:
- `RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED`: Enable or disable rate limiting (default: `true`)
- `USER_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW`: Time window in seconds for user rate limiting (default: `60`)
- `USER_RATE_LIMIT_MAX`: Maximum number of requests per user in the window (default: `10`)
- `TEAM_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW`: Time window in seconds for team rate limiting (default: `60`)
- `TEAM_RATE_LIMIT_MAX`: Maximum number of requests per team in the window (default: `100`)

The bot also includes an automatic cleanup process to prevent memory growth from stored rate limit data.

If you're experiencing issues with these features, check your deployment platform's documentation about file system access.

### Slack Configuration for Deployed Bot

1. After deployment, Railway will provide you with a URL for your application
   - Find this under the "Settings" tab in your Railway project
   - Copy the URL (it will look like `https://your-app-name.railway.app`)
2. Copy this URL and go to your Slack App's settings at [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
3. Select your app and then under "Event Subscriptions", enable events and set the Request URL to:
   ```
   https://your-railway-app-url.railway.app/slack/events
   ```
4. Save changes and verify the URL (Slack will check if your application is responding correctly)

### Testing Your Deployment

1. Invite your bot to a channel in your Slack workspace:
   - In Slack, go to the channel where you want to add the bot
   - Type `/invite @YourBotName`
2. Mention the bot with a message:
   - Type `@YourBotName Hello!` and send the message
3. If the bot doesn't respond, check Railway logs:
   - Go to your Railway dashboard
   - Click on your project
   - Click on "Logs" in the left sidebar
   - Look for any error messages that might explain the issue

## Development

### Technology Stack

- **FastAPI**: Web framework
- **Slack SDK**: For Slack API integration
- **OpenAI API**: For AI capabilities
- **DALL-E 3**: For image generation
- **Railway**: Deployment platform

### Local Development

If you want to run the bot on your local machine for testing or development:

1. Clone the repository to your computer:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   # Install uv if you don't have it yet
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

   # Install dependencies using uv
   uv pip install -e .
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a file named `.env` in the root directory
   - Copy the contents from `.env.example` into `.env`
   - Fill in your actual API keys and tokens

4. Run the application:
   ```
   uvicorn app:app --reload
   ```

5. To test with Slack, you'll need to expose your local server to the internet:
   - Install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) (a tool to create a tunnel to your local server)
   - Run ngrok: `ngrok http 8000`
   - Use the ngrok URL (looks like `https://something.ngrok.io`) in your Slack App's Event Subscriptions URL

### Automated Quality Checks

This project includes automatic code quality and security checks that run whenever new code is submitted. These checks:

- Ensure the code follows standard formatting rules
- Scan for potential security issues
- Verify all dependencies are safe to use

This means you can be confident that the bot maintains high quality and security standards without needing to run technical tests yourself. This is enabled using Github actions. See python-checks.yml for more details.

### Dependencies

Dependencies are managed using `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`. The project uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), a fast Python package installer and resolver. It requires Python 3.13+ and includes the following main packages:

```
fastapi
openai
pillow
pydantic
python-multipart
requests
slack-sdk
uvicorn
```

To add new dependencies, update the `pyproject.toml` file and run `uv pip install -e .` to regenerate the lock file.

## Troubleshooting
